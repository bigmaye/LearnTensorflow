    "# Overview\n",
    "TensorFlow is a programming system in which you represent computations as graphs. Nodes in the graph are called ops (short for operations). An op(node) takes zero or more Tensors, performs some computation, and produces zero or more Tensors. A Tensor is a typed multi-dimensional array. For example, you can represent a mini-batch of images as a 4-D array of floating point numbers with dimensions [batch_size, height, width, channels].\n",
    "\n",
    "A TensorFlow graph is a description of computations. To compute anything, a graph must be launched in a Session. A Session places the graph ops onto Devices, such as CPUs or GPUs, and provides methods to execute them. These methods return tensors produced by ops as numpy ndarray objects in Python, and as tensorflow::Tensor instances in C and C++."

    "## The computation graph\n",
    "TensorFlow programs are usually structured into a construction phase, that assembles a graph, and an execution phase that uses a session to execute ops in the graph.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, it is common to create a graph to represent and train a neural network in the construction phase, and then repeatedly execute a set of training ops in the graph in the execution phase.\n",
    "\n",
    "TensorFlow can be used from C, C++, and Python programs. It is presently much easier to use the Python library to assemble graphs, as it provides a large set of helper functions not available in the C and C++ libraries.\n",
    "### Building a graph\n",
    "To build a graph start with ops that do not need any input (source ops), such as Constant, and pass their output to other ops that do computation.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ops constructors in the Python library return objects that stand for the output of the constructed ops. You can pass these to other ops constructors to use as inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "The TensorFlow Python library has a default graph to which ops constructors add nodes. The default graph is sufficient for many applications. See the Graph class documentation for how to explicitly manage multiple graphs."
